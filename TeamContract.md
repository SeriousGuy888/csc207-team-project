# Team Contract of JASON

<!--
**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions.

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Purpose of this Contract

<!-- kept and slightly modified from the template provided -->

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how the members of JASON will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Definitions

- "**JASON**" is the name of our team. The constituent parts of this acronym are left as an exercise to the reader.
- "**Members**" refers to all members of JASON.
- The "**group chat**" refers to our Discord group chat.
- The "**(team) project repository**" refers to [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/SeriousGuy888/csc207-team-project) for the team project.
- Being "**locked in**" refers to being in a state of intense focus upon a single task or responsibility.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

- We will use the Discord group chat as our primary communication channel.

  - Members should check the group chat every day or notify other members if they will be unavailable for an extended period of time.

  - Members should not disappear (e.g. go on a sudden vacation; become excessively locked in to review for an exam for a week, thus not responding to team messages) without first notifying other members.

- All communications should remain friendly, respectful, and professional.

- Criticisms are welcomed only if they are constructive, project-focused, and accompanied by suggestions for improvement.

- Members are absolutely encouraged to ask for help if they get stuck after making honest attempts.

  - Members will not be judgemental (e.g. make unkind remarks) when another member requests help ❤️.

### Participation

- Members will attend all scheduled CSC207 lectures, CSC207 labs, and JASON team meetings unless illness or an emergency occurs.

  - Members should let others know beforehand if they cannot make it to any such scheduled meeting.

- Members will actively participate in discussions, contribute ideas, and find solutions to existing problems rather than passively waiting for others to assign tasks to them.

#### Preparation

- Members will make an attempt to read the assigned materials before class so we are able to complete the tRATs with optimal results.

### Collaboration

- No member should directly push to the `main` branch of the team project repository, and should instead make a pull request.

- Each pull request to `main` should be reviewed by at least two team members before getting merged.

- Members will constructively review each other's work (e.g. pull requests, work-in-progress uncommitted code) whenever they are able to.

### Accountability

- Members should either finish tasks that they agreed to complete by the agreed deadline, or notify other members beforehand if they cannot.

- Members will try their best to ensure their submitted work (e.g. contributions to the project codebase) function properly as expected.

- Members will provide honest and fair peer evaluations.

#### AI Usage

- Members will let others know when a piece of code is AI-generated.
- Members will test AI-generated code prior to committing it.
- Members will ensure that they understand the AI-generated code they commit.

## Decision Making and Conflict Resolution

- Decisions will be made by consensus when possible. If a consensus cannot be reached, a vote will be taken, and the majority opinion will be implemented.
- If the issue persists, the team will involve a member of the course teaching team as mediator. <!-- stolen directly from the sample contract -->
