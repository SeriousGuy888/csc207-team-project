All members must trust and respect JASON.

# Communication

 - We will use the Discord group chat as our primary communication channel. Members will check for updates on Discord every day.
 - All communications will remain friendly, respectful and professional.
 - Criticisms are welcomed only if they are constructive, project-focused and accompanied by suggestions for improvement.
 - Members are absolutely encouraged to ask for help if they get stuck after making honest attempts.
 - Members will not judge when somebody reaches out for help ❤️.

## Participation

 - Members will not disappear (eg. go on a trip, locked in for reviewing for a week) without priorly noticing other members
 - Members will attend all scheduled classes, labs, and team meetings unless illness or emergencies occur. (Let others know if member cannot make it prior)
 - Members will actively participate in discussions, contribute ideas and find solutions to existing problems rather than passively waiting for others to assign tasks to them.

## Collaboration

 - Each Pull Request will be reviewed by at least two team members before getting merged.
 - Members will constructively review each other's work whenever they are able to.

# Accountability

 - Members will finish the task assigned by deadline or notice other members beforehand.
 - Members will try their best to ensure their submitted work can function properly as expected.
 - Members will provide honest and fair peer evaluations.

## Preparation

 - Members will make an attempt to read the assigned materials before class so we are able to complete the tRATs.

## AI Usage

 - Members will let others know when a piece of code is AI-generated.
 - Members will test AI-generated code prior to committing them.
 - Members will ensure that they understand the AI-generated code they committed.

# Decision-Making

- Decisions will be made by consensus when possible. If consensus cannot be reached, a vote will be taken, and the majority opinion will be implemented.

# Conflict resolution

 - resolve merge conflicts in a civil manner (note from Phoebe: I think this part refers to interpersonal conflicts other than merge conflicts?)
