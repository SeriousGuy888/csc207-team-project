Classes will explore this evolution from different perspectives: they will consider approaches to the publication and dissemination of drama as a literary form; music, movement, and ritual; the development of theatre spaces; costume, set design, and acting style; the role of the censor; the design of popular advertisement and playbills; and various conceptualizations of the communal audience. Ranging in focus from music theatre to notorious plays and dramatists, from the role of the actor-manager to that of the literary polemicist and the visionary director, this course will also see students exploring original archival materials housed in the Kelly Library, workshopping scenes with guest lecturers, and, when possible, travelling to a relevant theatre production.

Tolkien, Ursula K. LeGuin, and George R.R. Martin. This course provides important scholarly and cultural context for studying these works in relation to warfare and medievalism in fantasy literature. In so doing, it explores the complex relationship between real-life conflict and literature that has continued to shape popular culture to the present day. Restricted to first-year students.

    "courseDescription": "This first-year foundation course explores the intricate relationship between medieval-themed fantasy literature and modern war. Drawing on the works of several of the most prolific 20th-century fantasy authors, it examines how the experience of global conflicts shaped the creation of secondary worlds informed by the Middle Ages in the works of such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien, Ursula K. LeGuin, and George R.R. Martin. This course provides important scholarly and cultural context for studying these works in relation to warfare and medievalism in fantasy literature. In so doing, it explores the complex relationship between real-life conflict and literature that has continued to shape popular culture to the present day. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.",
