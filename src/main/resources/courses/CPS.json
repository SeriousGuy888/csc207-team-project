Students will be trained in effective job searching skills (writing a CV and a Cover Letter, participating in job interviews) and will gain valuable experiences that are sought after by employers in both public and private sectors. Students will be placed with various employers in the GTA based on their interest and skill set, and on the employer needs and availability. The placement is a 200 h unpaid internship. The Course Coordinator/Instructor(s) will schedule biweekly meetings to discuss the setup and progress of the student projects. Student attendance is mandatory. At the end of the term, students must submit a written report and prepare an oral presentation about the outcomes of their work experience. In order to be considered for the internship, students must apply for the course. The Course Coordinator will approve enrolment in the course based on the number of internship opportunities available, which will vary from year-to-year, and student qualifications (e.g. GPA, experience, qualifications related to the requirements of the available placement(s), and interview performance).",

It provides an experiential learning opportunity with secondary school students and teachers. Students will research the literature of science pedagogy and acquire pedagogical content knowledge, particularly that of problem-based learning and the use of case studies. Then, through the creation of original, problem-based learning materials for Grades 11 and 12 classes and the preparation of teachers’ notes for these materials, they will enhance their subject specialization knowledge. They will then assist a teacher in implementing their materials in a school or, where the materials involve experiments, in the field or in the UTM teaching laboratories. The course is normally taken in the student's fourth year. Enrollment requires submitting an application to the CPS Department in the spring term, with the application due date being the final day of classes. Independent Studies Application Forms may be found at http://uoft.me/cpsforms. Applications should be submitted to the CPS Undergraduate Assistant. Registration on ACORN is also required.",
